I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 01 Part-1

Lab 1 is one of my personal favorite labs because it was the one that had started it all and was the introduction to all the future labs I would end up participating in. It had shown me just a very very small taste of what was yet to come. Looking back at it now, I feel a sense of humor, that back then I had believed that coding something like hello world was insanely difficult. Which is ironic because im sure in the labs to come I'd feel the exact same way as I did back then.

Lab 04 Part-1 & 2

Lab 4 is one of my other favorites because it was the first one where I actually had understood what linting was. I remember I was struggling trying to figure out what lint was in code. I was so confused as to why my code was running perfectly, but for whatever reason it would not pass the linting test. That's when I had searched the term up several times and realized that lint was the computer telling me that I could write my code more efficiently than what it was already. I remember spending over an hour troubleshooting and "linting" my group's code, but once I had finally finished, I felt amazing. It was exhilirating, I had finally figured out the problem that had been bugging me for over and hour.

Lab 07 Part-1

Lab 7 is my third favorite because it was an interesting code to me. My partner and I had essentially coded a calculator. Although I know we had done it before in an earlier lab using Julian Day, this one was different for me because when we had executed this code, we had given the days in the same line that we had executed the code to run. Rather than having the computer ask the user to input whatever values we wanted it to, we had given the computer the values in the same line that we used to execute it, using these arguments was an interesting concept to me because it showed how much time it could save for both the user and the machine executing the code.
